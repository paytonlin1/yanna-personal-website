#### **DESCRIPTION:**

- This is a portfolio website for my girlfriend.
- It is meant to be a place for her to display all her art, contact info, and social media in one place that is easily accessible for others.
- Created by Payton Lin for INFSCI 1570 Fall 2025

#### **DESIGN:**

- The design and format of the page was made in collaboration with my girlfriend through [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/zkz2YaGTcT1WVKXRBzkVGV/YannaWeb?node-id=0-1&t=eam3Tr45LHC2kKJz-1).

#### **HTML:**

- The HTML pages are similarly structued with minor differences depending on content.
- I tried to use semantic divs to make reading easier. I used tables to format the images and lists for the navigation so I could easily space them out.

##### Home

- This is the main page of the website and acts as the main hub for navigation. It contains an art display that is sorted by most recent work and a navigation panel accessible via the dropdown burger.

##### About Me

- A descriptive page talking about who the artist is.

##### Artist Statement

- A informational page that describes the work itself and the concepts/style/mediums of the artist.

##### Portfolio

- A page that displays all of the artist's work and contains filters that allow users to sort by medium.
- I could not get the buttons to work on this page and I couldn't figure out why.

##### Contact

- An informational page that contains links to the artist's social media pages and allows for users to directly email the artist via the input boxes.

#### __CSS:__

- I did a lot of formatting and tried using z-indexing for the first time.
